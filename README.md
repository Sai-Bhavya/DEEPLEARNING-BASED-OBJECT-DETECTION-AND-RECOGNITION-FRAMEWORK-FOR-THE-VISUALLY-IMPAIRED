Through my project, i aim to address a very real-world problem faced by the visually impaired individuals and the difficulty in recognizing and identifying objects in their surroundings.
" To solve this, we have developed a deep-Learning based object detection and recognition system. The core idea is to use to use head-mounter camera that captures images in real-time which are then processed using advanced neural networks like yolo and Mobile Net Once the objects are detected, the system converts the results into speech using a text to-speech module, which is then delivered to the user through on audio.
